# You are NOT alone

## Who are we?

This field attracts intelligent and introverted people who may be more prone to social anxiety, depression and ADD.

## Me and my ADD

I have been diagnosed with ADD.  Like many things, it's a strength and a weakness.  I am easily distracted, but I also have a penchant for intense focus, and can get "lost" in any problem.  I can ignore food and bathroom breaks, completely missing the passage of time for many hours - like a whole work day.  It was worse when I was younger, but it was easier to be functional. My schedule was more flexible and my highs made up for my lows.  When I was "on", I could make up for many hours of distraction in a short period of time.  Once I got a 9-5 job, my highs were cut-off and the environment encouraged my lows.  That's when I joined an ADD research study at NIH to see what I could do to correct for it.  Aw man - my initial observation is a story to share.  It was tough to admit it, but it was even tougher to continue living as only half a person.  I couldn't do the things I wanted to do, let alone needed to.  It's still with me, but at a lessor level.

I see it most when when I don't take care of myself.  I need my sleep, my food, my rest, my fun.

Why am I sharing this?  Why am I embarrassing myself up here?

I am a developer, and I have Type II BiPolar and ADHD.

It’s not something we talk about, but BiPolar, depression, and ADHD runs rampant
in the developer community – they tend to correlate with higher intelligence.
Many of the symptoms of this conditions make for great developers,
but also cause incredible damage.

We recently lost one of our co-workers because of untreated mental illness.
I want to share my story – and let people know that it’s okay to talk about these things,
that it’s nothing to be ashamed of, and how to get help,
and how to help those around them.” – Greg Baugues

Greg discusses the loss of a friend and Coworker, Caleb, to an accidental overdose while self-medicating his depression.  He also discusses the loss of software great, Aaron Swartz, to suicide in 2013. He notes that Swartz wrote this back in 2007:

“I have a lot of illnesses. I don’t talk about it much, for a variety of reasons. I feel ashamed to have an illness. (It sounds absurd, but there still is an enormous stigma around being sick.) I don’t want to use being ill as an excuse.

Sadly, depression (like other mental illnesses, especially addiction) is not seen as “real” enough to deserve the investment and awareness of conditions like breast cancer (1 in 8) or AIDS (1 in 150). And there is, of course, the shame.”

Baugues emphases that, “The shame is why we don’t talk about it. It’s why Caleb could struggle for a decade in this industry, surrounded by peers suffering the same affliction, and still feel alone.”

I don't want you to feel alone.  With any problem.  Be it a disability, pressure, or just a feeling of helplessness with the problem at hand.  I guarantee you there is someone close at hand who wants to help.  Just reach out.


## Us Geeks

Speaking of reaching out.

You are also joining a community with a high concentration of geek, nerds, and, yes, dorks.  Some of us wear those titles as badges of honor.  No, it's not as bad as you see on TV, but those stereotypes exists for a reason.  Some of us are much more comfortable conversing with our mom, or our cat, or... [our computer](http://dilbert.com/strip/1994-02-19).

We may not have had much opportunity to hang out with women who are intelligent, vivacious, and, well, lovely.  Having your attention directed at us, let alone a lovely smile, can be quite... disarming.  They may translate your attention and assistance as more than it is.  Please be understanding.  Take it as the compliment it is.

This is the reality for some.

Some have learned to control or filter their speech.  Some haven't.

You will encounter people who prefer to talk to your shoes.  Some will stare at your chest.  Some will stare at your chest because they don't know better.  Some, simply because they just need to avoid your eyes.

The same goes for men.  If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, please realize that it is likely that we simply don't know better.  Please assume the best and act accordingly.

## We are all Ambassadors

I recommend that you see yourself as an ambassador in a foreign land.  If you have some rapport with the person, kindly inform them, in private, that this behavior is not civilized.  Help them to understand.  And remember - there is a lifetime of conditioning (or lack thereof), they may not change immediately.

Certainly, if someone continues unacceptable behavior then escalate as appropriate.

It can be difficult to decipher between disorder and a simple lack of social skills.  I don't think that it matters.  Just be understanding and helpful.

## It isn't a fair world... yet

Currently, tech is guys world.  With guy jokes.  And guy habits.  Help us change that. Be aware.  Be alert.  Be empathetic.

## Takeaways

Here is what I hope you take away from this:
1. Not everyone is like you.  Have patience and understanding.
2. Help those around you get better. Whether it's coding or social skills.
3. I am not ADD.  I have ADD. Sometimes.
4. Remember.  You are not alone.  You are among friends.  We are probably going through something similar.  Find someone you can open up to.  

# Share.  Share.  Share.
